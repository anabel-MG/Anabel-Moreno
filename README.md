  Game 2 , Higher or Lower, has the player guess whether the next card will be a higher or lower value than the one being currently displayed. Similar to the last game, if the player guesses correctly they gain a point, otherwise they don't gain one. If the player draws a card of the same value they do not gain a point but do not loose one either, instead they are made aware that they didn't gain a point because the cards value matched. The game ends after the player has __ points.(describe the mechanisms of the game and what went into making it}
