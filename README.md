Card Games

 In this console app you have 3 card games to choose from, going from easiest to most challenging. The first game, apples or oranges has the player draw a card. The player then has to guess if the following card will be the same suit or different. If the player guesses correctly they get a point , other wise they do not gain any. The game ends when the player gets___ points.
(describe the mechanisms of the game and what went into making it}

  Game 2 , Higher or Lower, has the player guess whether the next card will be a higher or lower value than the one being currently displayed. Similar to the last game, if the player guesses correctly they gain a point, otherwise they don't gain one. If the player draws a card of the same value they do not gain a point but do not loose one either, instead they are made aware that they didn't gain a point because the cards value matched. The game ends after the player has __ points.(describe the mechanisms of the game and what went into making it}


  In the last game, Highest Match, the dealer shuffles a deck with 52 cards and 4 suits. The player is dealt 4 cards that only they can see.The dealer gets 4 cards aswell.Each  card has a value, the following go from lowest to highest: ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,joker(10),queen(11),and king(12).In the beginning of any round, the player has the option to end the game or countinue for up to 9 more round to try to get a better hand. Each round the player and the dealer can select one card to replace,the replacement will be the nect card from a shuffled deck. At the end of the game, the player's hand and the dealers hand are compared, whomever has the highest score will win.The score is calculated by adding together all values for cards of the same suit. Whatever the gighest amount is in each suit group, that is the player's final score.
